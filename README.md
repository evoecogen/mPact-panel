# mPact-panel
Scripts for analysis of phenotypic, genomic, and metabolic characteristics of the major Pseudomonas aeruginosa clone type (mPact) panel

This repository contains the raw data and R scripts required to recreate the analyses, plots and tables included in the mPact publication (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.15.575732). The sub-folder "bactabolize" contains the metabolic models reconstructed by Bactabolize (https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize) that were used in the mPact publication for pathway enrichment.

After cloning the repository, the scripts can be run inside the given folder structure. Outputs will be saved into the folders 'figures' and 'tables'. File exporting functions may be commented out in some scripts, but can be reactivated safely.
